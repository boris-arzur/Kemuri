 ** Description **

   == Japanese dictionary & flashcards like software for jailbroken
   == iphone/ipad/ipod touch.

This software only works on _jailbroken_ igadgets, since it needs ruby
& sqlite3 bindings for said language.

It's based on the KANJIDIC and KRADFILE projects, more
specifically on their xml versions and includes a sql version of these
projects, feel free to reuse them.
See http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/kradinf.html for Kradfile and
http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/kanjidic_doc.html for Kanjidic.

It creates a web server on 127.0.0.1:8185 that you can access with
safari and query for skip codes/kanjis/prononciations/translations of
english words, it also features jlpt's lists, and your own if you
spend some time building them.

I provide sqlite3 ruby bindings as a gzipped tarball (see
kemuri.sf.net) of the build tree, it's a not so old, not so recent
version, by all means please use the lastest one you may find at
sqlite-ruby's project page (http://rubyforge.org/projects/sqlite-ruby).

  ** Installation **

Upload all directory 'as-is' to your igadget & run 'ruby kemuri.rb' in
it, it will need to stay running so it might be more convienent to
execute 'ruby kemuri.rb & disown'.

Direct your browser to one of the sub-module :
  - http://127.0.0.1:8185/yad for the dictionary;
  - http://127.0.0.1:8185/yav for the flashcards;
  - http://127.0.0.1:8185/kan for Kanji info;
  - http://127.0.0.1:8185/skip for skip codes;
  - http://127.0.0.1:8185/rad for radical based search.

Basically each .sv.rb induced servlet is available through
http://127.0.0.1:8185/`basename ${file} .sv.rb`.

Please note this software uses ruby, sqlite3 and sqlite3-ruby, you
might need to get that installed before you can use Kemuri.
