<h2>** Description **</h2>

<div>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;== Japanese dictionary &amp; flashcards like software for jailbroken
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;== iphone/ipad/ipod touch.
<br/>
<br/>This software only works on <span class="ita">jailbroken</span> igadgets, since it needs ruby
<br/>&amp; sqlite3 bindings for said language.
<br/>
<br/>It's based on the KANJIDIC and KRADFILE projects, more
<br/>specifically on their xml versions and includes a sql version of these
<br/>projects, feel free to reuse them.
<br/>See <a href="http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/kradinf.html">Kradfile</a> and <a href="http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/kanjidic_doc.html">Kanjidic</a>.
<br/>
<br/>It creates a web server on 127.0.0.1:8185 that you can access with
<br/>safari and query for skip codes, radicals, kanjis, prononciations
<br/>or translations of english words, it also features jlpt's lists,
<br/>and your own if you spend some time building them.
<br/>
<br/>I provide sqlite3 ruby bindings as a gzipped tarball (see
<br/><a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/kemuri/">https://sourceforge.net/projects/kemuri/</a>) of the build tree,
<br/> it's a not so old, not so recent version, by all means
<br/> please use the lastest one you may find at sqlite-ruby's
<br/> project page (http://rubyforge.org/projects/sqlite-ruby).

<h2> ** Installation &amp; Usage ** </h2>

<div>
Upload all directory 'as-is' to your igadget &amp; run 'ruby kemuri.rb' in<br/>
it, it will need to stay running so it might be more convenient to<br/>
execute 'ruby kemuri.rb &amp; disown' or 'exec ruby kemuri.rb' in a 'screen' instance.<br/>

<br/>
Direct your browser to one of the sub-module :
<ul>
<li>http://127.0.0.1:8185/yad for the dictionary;</li>
<li>http://127.0.0.1:8185/yav for the flashcards;</li>
<li>http://127.0.0.1:8185/kan for Kanji info;</li>
<li>http://127.0.0.1:8185/sk for skip codes;</li>
<li>http://127.0.0.1:8185/rad for radical based search.</li>
</ul>

These modules are as RESTful as possible :
<ul>
<li>/yad/start looks for start in the dictionary;</li>
<li>/kan/漢 looks for 漢 in the database;</li>
<li>/sk/1-2-3 tries to match the skip 1-2-3.</li>
</ul>

Basically each .sv.rb induced servlet is available through<br/>
http://127.0.0.1:8185/`basename ${file} .sv.rb`.<br/>
<br/>
On most modules, you will find a 'smart' input box, you can push<br/>
text (we call it $1 in what follows) in it, it will try to redirect you :
<ul>
<li>'rad' and 'his' go to the modules /rad &amp; /his;</li>
<li>*-*-* (more specifically /^\d-\d+-\d+$/ ) and /^\d+$/ to /sk/$1;</li>
<li>/^\d-\d+-\d++\d-\d+-\d+$/ to /biskip/$1 (bruteforce a pair of<br/>
    skip-codes, a bit slow);</li>
<li>/^\d-\d+-\d+-\d-\d+-\d+$/ to /sk/$1;</li>
<li>a single kanji to /kan/$1 or /yad/$1 (you have to choose);</li>
<li>multiple kanjis or kana to /yad/$1.</li>
</ul>

In some modules, you will find a blue button, try to drag it, it can be used<br/>
to navigate and will show in its center where it is going to send you.<br/>
For example, in /yav, it is used to answer : 'y' is 'yes, I know the kanji',<br/>
'n' is 'no', 'h' is 'hibernate' and 'yy' is 'double yes'. Different answers have<br/>
different effects on the learning algorithm, please refer to the code.<br/>

Please note this software uses ruby, sqlite3 and sqlite3-ruby, you<br/>
might need to get that installed before you can use Kemuri.<br/>
