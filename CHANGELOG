  Look : a new way of searching for kanjis is here : combine radicals from
    whatever kanji you know, with vague skip codes (such as "it's a two part
    vertical kanji" or "there's 4 strokes on the top part") and stroke counts,
    glue these descriptions together with '&', add the possibility to look for
    more than one kanji at a time with '+' and you have the ultimate kanji
    searching application. Examples : 
     - typing 帯&1-3-_+在 in voyage, when you are looking for 滞在;
     - 特+残&1-_-_+医+病&小+研+究 for 特殊医療研究...
